                    wrapped up in illusions of personhood <br />
                    am i not allowed to feel? <br />
                    shadows haunt this person too <br />
                    yet i thought a 'no one' was not real <br />
                    burns prickle my skin <br />
                    salved with 'no one' tears of blue <br />
                    but it's all right <br />
                    only persons can feel wounds <br />
