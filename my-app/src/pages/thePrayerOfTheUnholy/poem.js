                    send your blessings <br />
                    down upon me. <br />
                    my storehouses of want <br />
                    overflow. <br />
                    replenish my <br />
                    thirst. <br />
                    for this water <br />

                    of the lost. <br />
                    I have <br />
                    been lost on<br />
                    my way to the graves<br />
                    of those with better<br />
                    things to offer.<br />
                    forsake me not, though<br />
                    I am wont to forsake<br />
                    You. <br />
                    if it was fair<br />
                    it would not be pleading,<br />
                    soothe my skin, <br />
                    which aches for<br />
                    hurting, to be transferred<br />
                    to those who unknow<br />
                    what hurting does.<br />
                    give me the strength<br />
                    my transgressors are many<br />
                    my transgressions, endless.<br />
