                    speak in soft lace <br />
                    wrapped in gentle whispers <br />
                    sent off with feather touches by <br />
                    haggard <br />
                    cotton pickin fingers <br />
                    work swiftly in touching <br />
                    I'm fragile when handled <br />
                    pieced together by golden glue <br />
                    be sure to not crack this mahogany<br />
                    hue <br />
                    dance your moonlight eyes this way <br />
                    morse code tapping signals to me <br />
                    which signals safety for those that <br />
                    see visions of you and I<br />
                    I'll take a ribbon now dear <br />
                    and wrap it softly round my throat <br />
                    send me off in baskets filled with <br />
                    blankets <br />
                    for once we're gone <br />
                    they can't reach us no more <br />
