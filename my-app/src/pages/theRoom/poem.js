                    I made a room for <br />
                    the sadness to set itself in - <br />
                    but what is there to say <br />
                    for the deepness that <br />
                    I have fallen into - it feels <br />
                    like home at this point <br />
                    like a place I'd known all along <br />
                    that I left before I was ready <br />
                    and returned to after it called for me <br />
                    I called out for this <br />
                    this sadness <br />
                    and it was true, I had to follow <br />
                    for it knew things of me <br />
                    that no one else had known before <br />
                    it knew me more than anything <br />
                    as well as I had known it too <br />
                    
                </p>
            </div>
