                    YEARS WERE SPENT WAITING

                    years were spent on my knees <br />
                    begging to Those who listened <br />
                    to make me like the other kids <br />
                    answers came in due time <br />
                    yet late enough to have answered <br />
                    these pleas on my own <br />
                    <br />
                    <i>betray not your heritage</i><br />
                    told by people who didn't care<br />
                    <i>listen harder, listen better</i><br />
                    which I tried, I truly did <br />
                    <br />
                    years strolled by beneath my knees <br />
                    skinning time away from me <br />
                    I still begged to Those who'd listen <br />
                    too much time had passed however <br />
                    They'd long stopped listening to me <br />
                   
                    
                    
                    
                </p>
