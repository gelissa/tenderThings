                    A BLACK IN THE BURBS

                    you're not really black <br />
                    they told me as they tried <br />
                    to understand <br />
                    it formed slowly in my mouth <br />
                    that taste when you've had something bad <br />
                    or maybe nausea <br />
                    whatever they were told<br />
                    they already knew what they thought<br />
                    I wasn't really black <br />
                    cuz I didn't jive or bite back<br />
                    I was docile <br />
                    a deer with lanky legs<br />
                    I was complacent <br />
                    a mother to her friends <br />
                    where did I belong then? <br />
                    if it was not here <br />
                    or was not there <br />
                    who was I supposed to be? <br />
                    if not like you <br />
                    or not like them <br />
                    many years were spent <br />
                    trying to be <br />
                    like me <br />
                    they shouldn't have taken it away <br />
                    they should have let me be <br />
                    at ease <br />
