                    THE CRY OF THE BROKEN WOMAN

                    tremblings hands <br />
                    clutched the pieces <br />
                    of my heart you <br />
                    left behind for <br />
                    me to pick up - <br />
                    worn down over <br />
                    years of labor <br />
                    to birth you into <br />
                    the man you were <br />
                    meant to become -<br />
                    my desires broke <br />
                    down with a pestle<br />
                    I was given to <br />
                    make flour for the <br />
                    bread you were<br />
                    winning - at home <br />
                    you left me to <br />
                    fend away a darkness <br />
                    that had begun <br />
                    to grow within me - <br />
                    you bathed yourself <br />
                    in waters shed <br />
                    from my storehouse<br />
                    for the children you'd <br />
                    promised me long ago. <br />
