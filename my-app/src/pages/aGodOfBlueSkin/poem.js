                    A GOD OF BLUE SKIN
                </h1>
                <p className="p">
                    your skin showed blue in the night <br />
                    and smelled of the heat <br />
                    of a thousand suns <br />
                    when i touched it <br />
                    a softness to challenge the clouds <br />
                    embraced me <br />
                    your eyes sang a song <br />
                    that your people gave you long ago <br />
                    only you could understand it <br />
                    you told me it was fine <br />
                    I would not be blinded <br />
                    after looking at the face of a god <br />
                    melancholy was your name <br />
                    but you changed it when you met me <br />
                    the only god I knew how to worship <br />
                    
                    
                </p>
            </div>
