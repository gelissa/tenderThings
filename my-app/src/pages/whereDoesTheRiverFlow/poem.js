                    from whence cometh my help <br />
                    when grey fills my mind <br />
                    when my eyes lose sight <br />
                    of what is, what could be — <br />
                    for who is listening <br />
                    to the distance which calls <br />
                    out, it's a voice not unlike my <br />
                    own, who was, who could have <br />
                    been — <br />
                    I seek a homecoming <br />
                    drifting ever farther <br />
                    into the grey — who <br />
                    is out there <br />
                    which might offer rest to <br />
                    a soul walking on aching feet? <br />
                    from which hill <br />
                    dost flow the <br />
                    river styx? <br />
                </p>
