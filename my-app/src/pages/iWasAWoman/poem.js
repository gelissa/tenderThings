                    one day someone told me <br />
                    i was a woman <br />
                    like a child, i didn't know <br />
                    i bared my baby teeth <br />
                    that suckled upon <br />
                    my mother's gold <br />
                    in my selfishness i bit her <br />
                    taking pieces of her with me <br />
                    that i had not <br />
                    already taken before <br />
                    pricking myself i checked <br />
                    to see if i bled too. <br />
