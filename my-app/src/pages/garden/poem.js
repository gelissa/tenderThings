                    blackberry juice sprang from my blackberry eyes - <br />
                    etched tears into my rust colored skin <br />
                    dirt brown skin <br />
                    flowers grow from these waters <br />
                    that sent people to grow gardens <br />
                    in lands that were not theirs <br />
                    blackberry juice sweetens blackberry wine <br />
                    with a kick <br />
                    throw refuse at me, I get stronger <br />
                    throw rocks at me, I get tougher <br />
                    spend years breaking my back <br />
                    for a house that is not mine <br />
                    rest upon a bed of linen and water <br />
                    scented with the perfume <br />
                    of fruit on the edge of rot <br />
                    rub my feet, dirt covered feet <br />
                    hard worked feet <br />
                    with the fruits of my labor <br />
                    pick flowers for your table <br />
                    from my skin <br />
                    eat your food off my back <br />
                    for your meal <br />
                    for all of it I have suffered <br />
                    my pain which you have reaped <br />
                    it is not mine anymore <br />
                    this blessed garden of my defeat <br />
                </p>
            </div>
